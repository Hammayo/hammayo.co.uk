This is my site codebase, designed and developed in VS2012 using AngularJS.

I designed, implemented, tore down, and redesigned my website many time in past, so now moving the code here primarily to showcase my coding style and also for version tracking.

This will be under constant scrutiny by myself, and hopefully, as a result, will always be improving :)

TBD...
